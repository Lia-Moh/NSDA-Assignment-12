# 📝 Todo App (NSDA Assignment 12)
This is my first fully functional web project — a **Todo List App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It was created as part of **NSDA Assignment 12**.

You can add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and your list stays saved even after refreshing — thanks to **localStorage**.
